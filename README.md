# Password Generator Starter Code


## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security




## Acceptable critieria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page



## Notes
* When `Generate Password` button is clicked, a prompt asks the question `How many characters would you like? The number has to be between 8 and 128.`

* Then you are asked to `confirm` `Do you want uppercase? ` `Do you want lowercase? ` `Do you want special characters? ` `Do you want numbers? `

* After answering all of the `confirmation prompts` a `window alert` shows the `generated password` and the password is shown in the `text Box`
